# DeCentGit
 DeCentGit is a decentralized version control prototype. It uses blockchain for   verifiable responsibility via cryptographic PushAttestations, separating data   from accountability. This offers trustless integrity and time-decaying   reputation for Git repositories, without storing code on-chain.
